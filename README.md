# Inconsistent Package Versions in Dockerfile Due to Missing `apt-get upgrade`

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked issue in Dockerfiles: omitting `apt-get upgrade` after `apt-get update`.  This can lead to inconsistent package versions across builds, resulting in unpredictable and difficult-to-debug behavior.

**The Problem:**

The provided `Dockerfile` uses `apt-get update` to refresh the package list.  However, it neglects to run `apt-get upgrade`, which installs any available updates for the currently installed packages.  Subsequent builds might install different versions of packages, leading to inconsistent environments.

**The Solution:**

The `DockerfileFixed` demonstrates the correct approach. By including `apt-get upgrade`, we ensure that the build process always uses the latest available versions of packages, creating a more consistent and reliable image.
